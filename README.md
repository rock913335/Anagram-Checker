# Anagram-Checker
Overview
The Anagram Checker is a Python program designed to determine if two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Features
Case insensitive comparison of strings
Ignores spaces in the strings
Validates that inputs contain only alphabetic characters
Efficient comparison using character frequency counting
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Installation
No additional installation is required, as the program uses standard Python libraries.

Files
anagram_checker.py: Contains the AnagramChecker class with methods to check anagrams.
anagram_test.py: Includes a suite of unit tests for testing the functionality of the Anagram Checker.
Usage
To use the Anagram Checker, simply import the AnagramChecker class from anagram_checker.py and create an instance of the class with two strings you want to check. Then, call the check_anagrams method.

Running Tests
To run the test suite, execute the anagram_test.py file. Ensure it's in the same directory as anagram_checker.py.
